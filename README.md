# Predictive Modeling with Linear Regression

## Introduction
This project focuses on building a predictive model using Linear Regression to estimate housing prices based on the California Housing Dataset. The goal is to understand the relationship between various features of the dataset and the target variable, which is the median house value. By employing linear regression, the project aims to create a model that can predict housing prices with reasonable accuracy.

## Objectives
- **Understand the Dataset:** Conduct a thorough exploration of the California Housing Dataset.
- **Feature Analysis:** Visualize and analyze the relationship between different features and the target variable.
- **Model Development:** Develop a linear regression model to predict housing prices.
- **Model Evaluation:** Assess the model's performance and visualize the accuracy of its predictions.

## Key Points

- **Dataset:** California Housing Dataset.
- **Data Overview:** Initial exploration using `head()`, `info()`, `dtypes`, `describe()`, and checking for missing values.
- **Data Visualization:** Analyzing the relationship between features and the target variable through visualizations.
- **Correlation Matrix:** Creating a correlation matrix to understand feature relationships.
- **Data Splitting:** Dividing the dataset into training and testing sets.
- **Feature Standardization:** Standardizing features to improve model performance.
- **Model Training:** Training a Linear Regression model on the prepared data.
- **Model Evaluation:** Assessing the model's performance using appropriate metrics.
- **Results Visualization:** Plotting actual values vs. predicted values to evaluate the model's accuracy.

## Requirements
- **Python 3.x**
- **Libraries:**
  - NumPy
  - Pandas
  - Matplotlib
  - Seaborn
  - Scikit-learn

## Results
The project results in a trained Linear Regression model capable of predicting housing prices. The accuracy of the model is visually assessed by comparing the predicted values against the actual values in a plot. This comparison helps identify the model's effectiveness and areas for potential improvement.
